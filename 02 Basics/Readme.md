> In Python, we can import function from another file and execute it.

> When you import a function or any module, Python compiles the files into bytecode for faster execution. This compiled bytecode is stored in the `__pycache__` folder inside the directory where your Python files are located.

> You do not need to worry about `__pycache__` folder. It is automatically managed by Python.
